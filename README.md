# Text-to-Image-generator
Stable Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model that generates realistic images based on textual descriptions. It was developed by CompVis, and its first version (v1.4) is one of the most commonly used models in various AI applications. Stable Diffusion is highly efficient in creating high-quality and detailed images from relatively simple text inputs, offering a range of creative possibilities.
In this project, we will explore how to create images from text using Stable Diffusion in Python, leveraging a model pre-trained by Hugging Face's Diffusers library and the Stable Diffusion Pipeline. This process enables generating detailed images based solely on textual prompts, which can be useful for artists, content creators, or even just for experimentation.
